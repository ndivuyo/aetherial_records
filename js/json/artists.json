		"question1" : "We are an artist duo, originally from Almaty, Kazakstan. One of us comes from an architecture / art background and the other one was a practicing musician / producer. The original concept for the project was to travel to various places and document our experiences through artworks. We wanted it to be simple, so that we allowed for imperfections and raw ideas. We also didn’t put a boundary on weather what we post online is visual art, sound art or a mixture of both. It could be either or both.  The project started entirely on our shared enthusiasm to collaborate, travel and make things. We wanted to feel the freedom to make and share whatever we wanted, without thinking much whether it’s good or bad. We feel that the ting that makes art special is the ability to transform any kind of personal experience into an abstract, metaphysical form.  If somebody , other than us, can connect with it too, it means that we were able to do something successfully.",
		"question2" : "It varies. Each place can put you into a certain mood or a creative headspace, that is unique and worth exploring. That is the reason we like to travel. From each place we visit and stay, be so Nairobi city center, a small village in India, mountain house in Kazakhstan, big city such as Berlin or Los Angeles, we learn so much and use whatever artifacts we find around to make things. Of course, a big inspiration to us is nature with all the intricacies of it’s design. It acts as a recharge for us. But we also love raw and imperfect things and thus various human made cultures are also inspiring. The outcome of what we do just varies. The most valuable thing we can name for creativity is time. We always feel, there’s not enough of it.",
		"question3" : "A lot has to do with found things. Whatever things we see around, we try to use in both meant-to and not-meant-to ways. On the hardware side it’s a camera, guitar, controllers like monome, lemur, wacom tablet, conventional music instruments. On the software side it’s Live, Reaktor, Max, Adobe products. We are also very fond of exploring new options, so the list constantly grows. Sometimes we use some things just ones, sometimes there are things the we constantly go back to.",
		"question4" : "If we had this opportunity, we’d just ask everybody to turn all the equipment off and be quiet for a minute. That would be quite an experience.",
